# Code of Conduct

We, the contributors and maintainers of the PyDAGMC project, are committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our project, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we commit to fostering an environment within our community that is free from harassment, irrespective of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, educational background, economic status, nationality, physical appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our pledge is to engage in behaviors and interactions that promote a community characterized by openness, inclusivity, diversity, and overall well-being.

## Expected Behavior

- Displaying empathy and kindness when interacting with others
- Showing respect for diverse opinions, perspectives, and backgrounds
- Offering and gracefully receiving constructive feedback
- Taking accountability, apologizing to those impacted by our errors, and growing through the process
- Prioritizing the collective well-being of the community, rather than just individual interests

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Engaging in sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
- Participating in trolling, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks
- Engaging in public or private harassment
- Sharing others' private information, like physical or email addresses, without explicit consent
- Exhibiting behavior that could be deemed inappropriate in a professional context

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated within the PyDAGMC community. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the project's community and public communication channels, temporary or permanent bans, and reporting to appropriate authorities.
