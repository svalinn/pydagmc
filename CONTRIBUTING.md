# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PyDAGMC! We welcome contributions from everyone.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to PyDAGMC. Please read it carefully to ensure a smooth and effective contribution process.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to PyDAGMC, including:

- **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please report it by opening an issue.
- **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Let us know by opening an issue.
- **Writing Code:** Contribute bug fixes or new features through Pull Requests.
- **Improving Documentation:** Help us make our documentation clearer, more complete, or fix typos.
- **Writing Tutorials or Examples:** Share your knowledge by creating new examples or tutorials.
- **Reviewing Pull Requests:** Help review contributions from others.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Git:** For version control.
- **PyMOAB:** PyDAGMC is built upon MOAB. Please ensure MOAB is installed and functional in your Python environment. Refer to the [MOAB installation guide](https://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/fathom/moab-docs/building.html).

### Setting up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository:**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [PyDAGMC GitHub page](https://github.com/svalinn/pydagmc). This creates your own copy of the repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pydagmc.git
    cd pydagmc
    ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    Using a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoids conflicts with other projects.

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
    Install PyDAGMC in editable mode along with development dependencies (for testing and documentation).

    ```bash
    pip install -e .[test,docs]
    ```

    This command installs the package from the current directory (`.`) in editable mode (`-e`), and includes the optional dependencies specified for `test` and `docs` in `pyproject.toml`.

5. **Set Upstream Remote:**
    This will help you keep your fork synchronized with the main repository.

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/svalinn/pydagmc.git
    ```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a New Branch:**
    Before making any changes, create a new branch from the `main` branch (or the most up-to-date development branch):

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main  # Ensure your main branch is up-to-date
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name  # For new features
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-short-description # For bug fixes
    ```

    Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-volume-creation`, `bugfix/fix-group-repr`).

2. **Make Your Changes:**
    Write your code, fix bugs, or improve documentation.

### Coding Style

- Follow [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Write clear, readable, and well-commented code where necessary.
- Use type hints for function signatures and variables as much as possible. PyDAGMC uses `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` for documentation.

### Writing Tests

- **All new features and bug fixes should include tests.** PyDAGMC uses `pytest`.
- Place your tests in the `tests/` directory.
- Ensure your tests cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases.
- Run tests locally before submitting a pull request:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

- Aim to maintain or increase code coverage. You can check coverage with:

    ```bash
    pytest --cov=pydagmc --cov-report=html
    # Then open htmlcov/index.html in your browser
    ```

### Updating Documentation

- **Docstrings:** For any new functions, classes, or methods, or changes to existing ones, update the docstrings. We use Google or NumPy style docstrings, which are compatible with Sphinx and Napoleon.
- **User Documentation:** If your changes affect user-facing behavior or add new features, update the relevant sections in the `docs/source/` directory (e.g., `user_guide.md`, `tutorial.md`, API pages).
- Build the documentation locally to ensure your changes render correctly:

    ```bash
    cd docs
    make clean html
    # Then open build/html/index.html
    ```

### Commit Messages

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- A good commit message summary should be 50 characters or less.
- If more detail is needed, provide it in the commit body after a blank line.
- Reference relevant issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Push Your Changes:**
    Once your changes are ready and tested, push your branch to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    - Go to the [PyDAGMC GitHub page](https://github.com/svalinn/pydagmc) in your browser.
    - You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch. Click it.
    - Ensure the base repository is `svalinn/pydagmc` and the base branch is `main`.
    - Provide a clear title and a detailed description using the provided [pull request template][pull-request-template] for your PR:
        - Summarize the changes made.
        - Explain the "why" behind your changes.
        - Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123").
        - Describe how your changes have been tested.
        - Include any necessary information for reviewers.

3. **Code Review:**
    - Maintainers will review your PR. Be prepared to address feedback and make changes. Changes that are pushed to your branch in your fork will automatically update the PR.
    - The CI checks (GitHub Actions) must pass before your PR can be merged.

4. **Merging:**
    Once your PR is approved and all checks pass, a maintainer will merge it into the main codebase. Congratulations, and thank you!
